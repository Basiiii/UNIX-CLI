# UNIX-Sys-Control

## Overview

This project involves the implementation of a set of commands for file
manipulation, a custom command-line interpreter, filesystem management
tasks, and filesystem analysis. The tasks are divided into three main
parts: file manipulation commands, a custom command-line interpreter, and filesystem management tasks. Each part comes with specific requirements and constraints,
aiming to test and enhance the understanding of system calls, process
management, filesystem operations, and filesystem analysis techniques.

## Features

1. Implement file manipulation commands:
   - Show file contents
   - Copy files
   - Append contents of one file to another
   - Count lines in a file
   - Delete files
   - Display filesystem information for a file
   - List files and directories in a specified or current directory
2. Develop a custom command-line interpreter:
   - Read and execute user-entered commands
   - Indicate readiness with "%" symbol
   - Execute commands using process execution primitives
   - Suspend interpreter until command completion
   - Support sequential execution of multiple commands
   - Terminate interpreter with a special command
3. Manage filesystems:
   - Add a new dynamically allocated disk
   - Create partitions and volumes
   - Mount filesystems with persistence across reboots
   - Establish ext4 and ext3 filesystems
   - Configure file permissions based on user and group settings
4. Perform filesystem analysis:
   - Identify start block of regular files
   - Retrieve content of specific files from a filesystem image
