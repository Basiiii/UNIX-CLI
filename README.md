# UNIX-CLI

## Overview

This project involves the implementation of a set of commands for file
manipulation and a custom command-line interpreter. This project comes with specific requirements and constraints, aiming to test and enhance our understanding of low level system calls to the operating system and, process management.

## Features

1. Implement file manipulation commands:

   - Show file contents
   - Copy files
   - Append contents of one file to another
   - Count lines in a file
   - Delete files
   - Display filesystem information for a file
   - List files and directories in a specified or current directory

2. Develop a custom command-line interpreter:

   - Read and execute user-entered commands
   - Indicate readiness with "%" symbol
   - Execute commands using process execution primitives
   - Suspend interpreter until command completion
   - Support sequential execution of multiple commands
   - Terminate interpreter with a special command
